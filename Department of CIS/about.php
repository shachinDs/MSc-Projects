                    <p>
                        The related BCA Department has started its journey during the period of University College under NBU with BCA Program. 
                        Though after the functioning of Raiganj University, in the year 2016 Honorable Vice Chancellor 
                        <b>Prof. (Dr.) Anil Bhuimali</b> has (during the <b>Headship of Dr. Ashoke Das)</b> initiated to start a PG Program/ Department
                         in the area of Computing & Informatics and thereafter respected members and Chair of the Departmental Committee
                         has accepted the proposal of <b>Dr. P.K. Paul</b> regarding establishing an interdisciplinary and new skill 
                         based Departmental nomenclature with the name of Department of Computer and Information Science (Since 09-11-2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nomenclature of the Department ‘CIS’ has started to keep the expertise and academic affairs much broader and 
                        working and merging related subjects (such as Computing, Computer Science, Information Science, Informatics, IT, ICT and 
                        also other hand allied domain based IS/IT subjects e.g. Health Information Science, Quantum Information Science, 
                        Library Information Science, Geo Information Science). Moreover university has followed international and contemporary 
                        style of academic dealing and as a result MSc-Computer & Information Science program has been started from 2016. 
                        The main agenda of the Department is to produce not only scientific thoughts among its students but also prepare
                         them for the industry and for that Applied curriculum has been adopted in the line of the universities, aboard. 
                         Hence the Department of CIS is following the style of iSchools (that practiced globally, in recent past) academic
                          attributes in their agenda for promoting interdisciplinary research and industrial products.

                    <p>
                        In the year 2018 Department also started its one of its kind and interdisciplinary program M.Phil.
                         & Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science (CIS) with specialization in Business Informatics & Social Informatics. 
                         Further, since 2018 Department also started BCA Evening/ Self Financed program. As the department holds broad objective 
                         and subject areas therefore from the year 2019 Computer Science programs also started under the Headship of
                         <b> Prof. K.S. Tiwary</b> with the degrees B.Sc. (H) in Computer Science and also M.Sc. Computer Science; as a result based on 
                          subject and Division the Department holds following—
                    </p><b>
                    <p>i.Computer Science (with B.Sc. & M.Sc.)</p>
                    <p>ii.Computer Applicat ion (with BCA Day & Evening)</p>
                    <p>iii.Computer & Information Science (with M.Sc., M.Phil. & Ph.D.)</p></b>


                    Moreover, since the Department holds a ‘school’ type of nature therefore in near future also it is interested to offer more
                     interdisciplinary and skill based Information Sciences and Computing programs with different level of education.
